## Sample AI Prompts You'd Use

### For Midjourney:
```
A friendly 12-year-old student for classroom app, modern vector illustration, soft purple gradient background (#667eea), clean professional style, diverse ethnicity, cheerful expression, school clothes, centered composition --v 6 --ar 1:1 --style raw
```

### For DALL-E 3:
```
Professional character illustration for educational app. 12-year-old student with friendly smile, wearing casual school clothes. Clean modern vector art style with soft purple background gradient. High quality, suitable for classroom management software. Diverse and inclusive representation.
```

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Generate 8 base characters with 5 expressions each (40 total)
2. **Phase 2**: Create accessory overlays (glasses, hats, etc.)
3. **Phase 3**: Build composite system that combines base + expression + accessory
4. **Phase 4**: Integrate with your existing avatar system
5. **Phase 5**: Add customization interface for teachers/students

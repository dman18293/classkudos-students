# Student Login Codes for Teachers

## Security Enhancement
Students now require unique login codes to access their accounts. This prevents students from accessing other students' accounts and ensures secure access.

## How It Works
1. Students select their teacher's class
2. Students click on their name
3. System prompts for their unique login code
4. Only with the correct code can they access their account

## Login Codes by Class

### Ms. Johnson's 1st Grade Class
- **Alex Thompson**: AT2024
- **Emma Rodriguez**: ER2024  
- **Jake Martinez**: JM2024
- **Sophia Chen**: SC2024

### Mr. Smith's 4th Grade Class
- **Michael Brown**: MB2024
- (Other students need codes assigned)

### Mrs. Davis's 5th Grade Class
- Students need to be assigned login codes

### Ms. Garcia's 4th Grade Class
- Students need to be assigned login codes

### Mr. Anderson's 5th Grade Class
- Students need to be assigned login codes

### Mrs. Chen's 6th Grade Class
- Students need to be assigned login codes

## For Teachers:
1. **Share these codes ONLY with the respective students**
2. **Keep codes secure** - don't post publicly
3. **Consider changing codes periodically** for enhanced security
4. **Help students who forget their codes**

## Code Format Recommendation:
- Use student initials + year (e.g., "AT2024" for Alex Thompson)
- Keep codes simple but unique
- Avoid predictable patterns students could guess
